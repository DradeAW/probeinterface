Overview
=======

Explain first the problem with 2 index one for physical electrode and one for device channel.
Give neuronexus + openephys example.

Describe here the two object

Probe

ProbeBunch


Goal
-------

If this package is widely adopted, then I plan to implement a collections of widly use probe fomr:

  * neuronexus
  * imec
  * cambridge neurotech


Aknowledgement
---------------------------

This work is based on the package MEAutility made by Alessio buccino.
https://github.com/alejoe91/MEAutility

The MEAutility is focusing on generating current over electrodes for MEArec.

Here, in probeinterface the focus is to combinate several Probe to handle complex wiring
for experimental description.
