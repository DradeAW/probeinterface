* Fix a **strong bug** in read_spikeglx()/read_imro() that was leading
  to wrong contact locations when the Imec Readout Table (aka imRo)
  was set with complex multi bank pattern.
  **You should maybe re-run all your analysis with this update if you have a doubt**
  **on the contact positions for recent spike sorting**
  A big thanks to Tom Bugnon to catch this.
